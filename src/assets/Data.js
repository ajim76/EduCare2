As a result many meritorious students are deprived of the opportunity of taking engineering education. A large number of students are required to migrate from Mumbai to some other University. This results not only in extra expenditure for the parents but also leads to depression amongst the students. After careful observations, through Survey of different institutions ‘The Atharva Educational Trust’ has decided to come forward forthe noble cause of technical Education and open the new Technical institution which will impart technical education in High – Tech areas like Computers, Information Technology and Electronics & Telecommunication, Electronics Engineering.\n\n‘The Atharva Educational Trust’ believes in producing well discipline, practical oriented, highly knowledgeable Engineers to serve not only for themselves butforthe society and nation. To makethis dream come true the Trust has developed the infrastructure first and proved their merit in getting recognition from Govt, of Maharashtra & A.I.C.T.E. New Delhi, the body for promoting technical education of high quality in India established by Govt, of India.\n\nThe Atharva Educational Trust’ owns spacious campus in Malad, where an ideal educational ‘Atharva College of Engineering’ campus has grown in leaps and bound in short span of time. The Institute has started functioning from the academic year 1999-2000 & has achieved good results in the University of Mumbai since then. The institution has developed laboratories with sophisticated equipments. Learned, disciplined and qualified staff is going to be another attraction for the students in this institution.",
